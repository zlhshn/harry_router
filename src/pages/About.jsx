                Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on the wizarding and Muggle
                worlds: his Death Eaters kidnap Mr Ollivander and destroy
                London's Millennium Bridge. With Lucius Malfoy incarcerated in
                Azkaban, Voldemort chooses his son, Draco Malfoy, to carry out a
                secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco's mother, Narcissa, and aunt
                Bellatrix Lestrange seek out Severus Snape, who gains their
                confidence by claiming he is a mole within the Order of the
                Phoenix.
